3. How can you implement a for loop to print only the odd numbers between 102 and 66 in descending order in the OddNumbers.java class?
- START_NUM - 1 ensures the loop starts from 101 (the first odd number below 102).
- The condition i >= END_NUM ensures the loop stops when the number drops below 66.
- The i -= 2 decrements by 2 to print odd numbers only.
